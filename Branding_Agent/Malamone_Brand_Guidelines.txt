**Malamone Brand Guidelines**

**1. Mission**
Our mission at Malamone is to sweeten every child's taste buds with our delectable range of, accessible and affordable sweets. We are dedicated to spreading smiles, one child at a time.

**2. Vision**
To become the most recognizable and favored brand of sweets for children everywhere by providing a delightful and diverse array of delicious treats.

**3. Typography**
Typography plays a crucial role in establishing our brand identity. It communicates the emotion of our brand at every touch point. 

Primary Font: Use "Chalkduster" for headings. This fun and informal font style conforms to our friendly and approachable brand tone. 

Secondary Font: Use "Arial" for body text, offering easy readability and simplicity, which aligns with our core value of accessibility.

**4. Color Palette**
Our color palette is as vibrant and delightful as our sweets. We use a diverse range of colors to reflect the variety in our product range. 

- Primary Colors: Bright Red(RGB 255,0,0), Sunny Yellow(RGB 255,255,0) and Bubblegum Pink (RGB 255,105, 180) replicate the fun and enthusiasm of our brand.

- Secondary Colors: Baby Blue(RGB 137,207,240) and Jelly Green(RGB 0,255,0) are used to soften the intensity of our primary colors, and create a balanced, delightful visual aesthetic.

**5. Logo Usage**
Our logo – a playful, stylized script spelling out 'Malamone' in bright red – is an integral part of our brand. 

- Always keep a safe area around the logo to ensure its visibility and impact.
- The logo should not be tampered with in terms of colors, elements, or orientation.
- Ensure it remains easily readable and recognizable at all adjusted sizes.
